ZOOM
/*But simply setting the filter/opacity value in IE isn’t enough. Turns out that IE requires an element to be positioned in order for filter/opacity to work. If your element doesn’t have a position you can work around this by adding ‘zoom: 1‘ to your CSS. There are other hacks to deal with this, zoom was the one I picked and it seems to work well enough.

In JavaScript you can find out if an element in IE has a position component by checking element.currentStyle.hasLayout. If hasLayout is false then the element has no CSS positioning.
