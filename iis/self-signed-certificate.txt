-----------------------------------------
HOST HEADER WITH SSL
-----------------------------------------

You have to be in directory %windir%\system32\inetsrv\

	appcmd set site /site.name:websitename /bindings.[protocol='https',bindingInformation='*:443:'].bindingInformation:*:443:local.childsupport.org

For example, to configure a site named contoso with an existing HTTPS binding for all IP addresses, on port 443, without a host header to have a host header named marketing, type the previous command at the command prompt, and then press ENTER:



Things to remember:

1. One certificate per IP address

2. One certificate for multiple sites is possible with a wildcard certificate

3. If you change the certificate for one site it will automatically change all the other ones that are using that same IP address/PORT

4. The appcmd helps you add host names to SSL bindings.

5. If you have ip and host header in IIS both need to macth in order to get to the right site not either or.
