I HAVE A SOLUTION! Thank you so much for the suggestions. I have not tried them yet but I plan to do so to see if they will work for me. For now I wanted let you know that I found something else that finally worked for me:

Dim host As System.Net.IPHostEntry
host = System.Net.Dns.GetHostByAddress(Request.ServerVariables.Item("REMOTE_HOST"))
strComputerName = host.HostName
