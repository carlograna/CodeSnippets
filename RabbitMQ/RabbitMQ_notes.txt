RabbitMQ
Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP)
Message broker that implements AMQP

Publisher -> Exchange ->
						Queue 1 -> Consumer
						Queue 2 -> Consumer


Core Concepts
Producer emits messages to exchange
Consumer receives messages from a queue
Binding connects an exchange with a queue using binding key
Exchange compares the routing key with the binding key
Messages distribution depends on exchange type
Exchange types: fanout, direct, topic and headers
Default (nameles)exchange
Special exchange created by RabbitMQ
Compares routing key with queue name
Indirectly allows sending directly to queues
