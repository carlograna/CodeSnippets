ORDER OF MAINTENANCE TASKS.

If it was code this how the maintenance task order would work:

if (Check Database Integrity succeeds)
{
    Rebuild Index OR (Reorganize Index and Update Statistics)
   
    Back Up Database (Full) or Back Up Database (Differential)
    if (Back up Database (Full) succeeds)
    {
        Backup Database (Transaction Log)
        Maintenance Cleanup Task
    }

    Shrink Database (never)
}

Run these anytime:
    Execute SQL Server Agent Job
    History Cleanup
